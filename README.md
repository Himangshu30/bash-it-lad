# bash-it-lad
Bash-it is a collection of community Bash commands and scripts for Bash 3.2+. (And a shameless ripoff of oh-my-zsh ðŸ˜ƒ)

Includes autocompletion, themes, aliases, custom functions, a few stolen pieces from Steve Losh, and more.

Bash-it provides a solid framework for using, developing and maintaining shell scripts and custom commands for your daily work. If you're using the Bourne Again Shell (Bash) regularly and have been looking for an easy way on how to keep all of these nice little scripts and aliases under control, then Bash-it is for you!
Stop polluting your ~/bin directory and your .bashrc file, fork/clone Bash-it and start hacking away.
